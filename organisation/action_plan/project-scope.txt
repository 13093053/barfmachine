== Research and design:
The results of the research and design work will be shared with the client by means of three research papers and several reports.
Speaker:
The speaker is supplied by the client and therefore this part of the project requires no further research or design work.

Power amplifier:
The amplifier will be designed by the project group and needs to meet the client's specifications.

Pre amplifier:
The pre-amplifier schematics are supplied by the client. Various component values need to be calculated to meet specifications.

Power supply:
