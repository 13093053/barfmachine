The voltage gain can be determined by using the following formula.

G = Uout/Uin

Uout = OUt,max = 11V and the supply delivers Uin = 18v, thus this will conclude in the following:

G = 11/18 = 0.6111 V

If gain needs the be determined in dB then gain dB = 20log(g)

gain dB = 20log(0.6111) = -4.2776 dB


Due to the use of a inverting amplifier configuration the following formula will apply

Zin = R1

Since Zin need to be atleast 50K the resistor R1 needs to be equal or more then 50k.


To calculate the output impedance the following formula can be used

Vout/Vin = Zout/Zin

11/18 = Zout / 50*10^3 = 30555.55556 ohm
