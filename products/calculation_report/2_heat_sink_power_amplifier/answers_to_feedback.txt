Question: Why did you assumed the surrounding temperatuur to be 70 degrees? Is this not to overspecified?
Answer: Maybe it should be like between 20 and 25 degrees but the 70 is just an example. It can really go up to 
	70 degrees if it's for example near a stove where you cook.


Question: Where does this 10 comes from in the denumerator?
Answer: The 10 comes from 25 - 15. The 15 is from the maximum outputpower and the 25 is can be read from a graph in the datasheet. The graph is called
	Power Dissipation vs. Power Output


Question: Is it not strange to say, required maximum power? What do you mean actually?
Answer: It's the maximun average power that the IC can dissipate before it overheats and shuts down.



Question: Explain eq4
Answer: The eq was given in the datasheet. It can't be really explain.




Question: So, what is your conclusion then? What heat sink should you use? 
Answer: I though heatsink wasn't suppose to be chosen. (not stated in the projectbook). conclusion: we can use a heatsink with a thermal resistance lower than 6,8 C/W
	somethinh like that.





Question: How and did you made a choice on your power amplifier? Not mentioned in the report.
Answer: The choise of the power amplifier was made but why must it be mentioned or explained in a heatsink report??? -.-. 
	The chosen power amplifier is explained in the power amplifier calculation report. The how part is: by comparing the results of the
	"berekeningen" and comparing them with the components in farnell. 








in line 22. It should be 25W instead of 15W.
