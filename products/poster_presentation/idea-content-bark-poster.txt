1. Introduction
The company BARK is a small and well-known loudspeaker manufacturer. BARK have been planning to develop a series of active speakers, using built-in power amplifiers but  BARK  however have limited knowledge on analogue and digital electronics systems. It is up to group one to conduct research and design an active loudspeaker with the conditions that BARK has given.

2. Design
Insert figure 10 and 22 (final design report)
The figure 10 shows the block-diagram of the BARK-machine and figure 22 shows the final design of the BARK-Machine.


3. Components
The speaker system consist of the following parts:
	Digital control unit
  	Power amplifier
 	Power supply
	The preamplifier
 	   Volume control
 	   Tone control
	   Balance control



4. Research
	a. Simulations
		Insert figure 13 and 14
Figure 13 shows a simulation of the bode plot of the preamplifier with the bass
and treble both at maximum boost
Figure 14 shows the simulation of the bode plot of the preamplifier with the bass
and treble both at maximum attenuation

	b. Measurements
		Insert figure 15 and 16
Figure 15 shows a bode plot of the preamplifier with the bass and treble both at
maximum boost
Figure 16 shows a bode plot of the preamplifier with the bass and treble both at
maximum attenuation

5. results
Insert table 1 in chapter 8.3 of the final design report



6. conclusion
The BARK-machine meets the specification set by the company BARK after testing and measuring the Bark-machine.
