Group 1 also held a meeting regarding the folder structure in Dropbox.
 In fact, rather than using Dropbox, the question was raised whether GitHub
 would be used instead.
 After 10 to 15 minutes of discussion, the team agreed on using GitHub instead
 of Dropbox because of its focus on file versioning rather than purely file-sync
ing.
 Using the GitHub website in combination with Git allows for easy reversion
 of changes and detailed logging of changes made to files, which is very
 useful in case of writing programming code and working on reports collaborative
ly.
 The main point of discussion for the choice of Dropbox vs.
 GitHub was the ease-of-use.
 Dropbox's user-friendliness is undeniably better compared to using Git/GitHub.
 But considering the aforementioned benefits, Git (with GitHub) ended up
 being the preferred choice.
 Previous (mostly positive) experience working with Git and GitHub also
 played a significant role in this.

During the project management lesson in the second week, lectures were given
 regarding the work breakdown structure (WBS) and the product breakdown
 structure (PBS).
 At the end, exercises were given regarding the WBS and PBS that were discussed.
 This way, the students got more insight in the WBS and PBS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the second project management lecture, group 1 held a meeting regarding
 the project management assignment that needs to be handed in at the end
 of the second week.
 The assignment was to create a WBS for the project, 'PRO-Q2'.
 During the meeting the team discussed how the WBS would be drawn.
 After 20 to 30 minutes of discussion, a sketch was made as seen in figure

\begin_layout Standard
The process of completing the assignment of the second week went favorable
 in general.
 There were no disputes between the team members.
 There were some light disagreements but those disagreements were easily
 solved by discussing the members' opinions and making a decision that all
 the project members could agree on.

\begin_layout Standard
Planning was discussed during the project management lectures in the third
 week of term 3.
 Planning can be done by using the seven steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Determine dependencies between activities;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Divide activities between team members (or 3
\begin_inset script subscript

 parties);

\begin_layout Enumerate
Estimate the Work and Duration times of the activities;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the total estimated duration of the project and the Critical Path;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Align start and end dates of activities with team member agendas;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compare planning with existing preconditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was also one other topic that was covered and that was multitasking.
 'Multitasking kills you', was the message conveyed in this part of the
 lesson.
 There was an exercise done regarding multitasking and the results spoke
 for themselves.
 It was not hard to deduce that multitasking can indeed be a dangerous this
 to do and therefore focusing on one task at a time is best before proceeding
 to the next one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the lectures, the members of team 1 came together for a meeting.
 During the meeting the members checked all the deadlines of all the deliverable
s in the manual and jointly made a draft of what the planning in excel could
 look like; when the deadlines of the deliverables are and which team member
 will complete it.
 Once the draft was complete, one team member edited all the information
 of the draft in the excel sheet.
 After the excel sheet was finished, it was sent to all other team members
 for feedback.
 The planning in the excel sheet was edited a few times until all members
 agreed with it.
 The planning was then sent to the teachers at the end of week 3.

The project management assignment of the third week is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Write a short statement on how you as a team will handle ‘Project Execution’.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the lesson, an eighth step was introduced in addition to the seven
 steps presented in the previous week: 'Monitor progress'.
 The concept of visualizing 'project control' was presented as well.
 Time, money and the scope of the project could be graded as 'most flexible',
 'optimize' and 'least flexible'.
 Each grade can only be assigned once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later that day, during the meeting with project coach Mr.
 op den Brouw, the project control visualization was explained and Mr.
 op den Brouw, representing the management of (the fictional company) BARK,
 was asked to fill in a table where the three aspects and three grades of
 flexibility were lined up.
 This way the team would have a better idea of the preferred priorities
 for the three aspects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later that week, a member of the team wrote the initial version of the project
 execution statement.
 After it was read through and approved by the other members, the final
 version was submitted.
